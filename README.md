###Inspiration - Site Design

Like: clean layout, blend of texture and flat, colors, uncluttered, subtle animation (arrows on slider are nice)

Gorgeous landing page, also like About and Contact pages. Like the colors, the spaciousness, the texture, the elegance, the subtle animation.

Very effective call to action. Simple shapes, minimal color. Cool animated logo. Quite a bit of animation, but with a purpose.

Flat plus texture, bright colors, modest animation. The FAQ section is ugly, however.
